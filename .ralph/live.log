Let me check the current state of the fix plan to see what's left.

Only one unchecked item remains: **Extension icon and README for marketplace**. Let me check what's already in place.

The icon already exists. Just need a README. Let me also check if `package.json` needs an `icon` field for marketplace.

All items in `fix_plan.md` are now checked. Here's what was done this loop:

- **`README.md`** — Created marketplace-ready README with features list, getting started guide, `commands.json` format documentation, field reference table, and configuration settings
- **`package.json`** — Added `icon` field pointing to the existing `media/icon.svg`

**All fix_plan.md items are now complete.** TypeScript compiles cleanly.
