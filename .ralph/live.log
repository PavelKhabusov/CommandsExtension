Now I have full context. Let me implement the Marketplace feature across all 5 tasks.

Now add the Marketplace CSS styles.

Now update `media/main.js` to handle Marketplace rendering. I need to add a message handler for `updateMarketplace` and a render function.


⚡ [Edit]

Now add the `renderMarketplace` function before the `// Signal to extension` line at the bottom.

Now wire the marketplace into both providers. I need to:
1. Import `getMarketplaceTemplates` in both providers
2. Send marketplace data alongside commands on `ready`/`refresh`
3. Handle `addTemplateGroup` and `addTemplateCommand` messages


⚡ [Edit]

Now update `_sendCommands` in sidebar to also send marketplace data.


⚡ [Edit]

Now add `addTemplateGroup` and `addTemplateCommand` message handlers in the sidebar provider.


⚡ [Edit]

Now do the same for `webviewPanel.ts`.


⚡ [Edit]

Update `_update` in webviewPanel to send marketplace data.


⚡ [Edit]

Now add the marketplace message handlers to webviewPanel's `_handleMessage`.

The commit needs user approval. All implementation is complete and compiled successfully. Here's a summary of what was done:

**Marketplace feature fully implemented across 5 files:**

1. **`src/marketplace.ts`** (new) — `TemplateGroup` interface + 6 hardcoded template groups: React, Node.js Backend, Docker, Testing, Linting & Formatting, Git Hooks (24 total template commands)

2. **`media/main.css`** — Added full Marketplace styling: collapsible accordion section, template group rows with icon/name/description/badge/add button, expandable command lists with individual add buttons, hover-reveal `+` buttons

3. **`media/main.js`** — `renderMarketplace()` function: accordion section below commands, expandable groups showing individual commands, sends `addTemplateGroup`/`addTemplateCommand` messages to extension

4. **`src/sidebarProvider.ts`** — Sends marketplace templates on ready/refresh, handles `addTemplateGroup` and `addTemplateCommand` messages with success notifications

5. **`src/webviewPanel.ts`** — Same marketplace integration as sidebar provider

`npm run compile` passes cleanly. All 5 fix_plan items are now checked off.
